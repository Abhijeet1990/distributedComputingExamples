# Examples for Distributed Computing

Here I provide the source codes of the examples that I use in my distributed computing course.

1. [sockets](http://github.com/thomasWeise/distributedComputingExamples/tree/master/sockets/)
    1. in [c](http://github.com/thomasWeise/distributedComputingExamples/tree/master/sockets/c)


Since I also use the same code in my slides, there are some special comments such as `//(*@\serverBox{2)}@*)` for formatting in my codes ... you can safely ignore them ^_^
