# Prints "Hello World"

This is an extremely small example for a [`C`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29) program. The main reason for it to exist is that you can verify that your compiler works. This is especially important when installing [MinGW](http://mingw.org/) in order to use [GCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection) under [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows).

Windows: `gcc helloWorld.c -o helloWorld.exe`
Linux: `gcc helloWorld.c -o helloWorld`
