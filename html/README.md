# Examples for Distributed Computing

Here you can find some _very simple_ examples for [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).

## 1. example_plain

Just a plain HTML document with an image inside.

## 2. `example_css`

A really minimal example HTML document with a CSS style sheet.

## 3. `example_javascript`

A HTML document which prints the current date and time via JavaScript.

## 4. `example_javascript_calculator`

A HTML document which can be used as calculator. The user can enter an expression into a text box. When she presses a button, this expression is evaluated as JavaScript expression and the evaluation result is printed. Of course, this is an example for JavaScript.

## 5. `pse`: The Periodic System of Elements

This is actually quite an old example which I did, I believe, back in high school. It shows the [periodic table of elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table). The single elements are clickable. When you click them, a small window with detailed information opens.

This example uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It is in German language, though, and probably a bit out-dated in terms of the element data.
