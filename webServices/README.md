# Examples for Web Services

Here you can find examples for using [Web Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service). Web services are the basic foundation of many distributed enterprise computing systems and [service-oriented architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture). Since they use the [XML](http://github.com/thomasWeise/distributedComputingExamples/tree/master/xml/)-based [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) protocol usually over [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), they can be implemented as Java Servlets](http://github.com/thomasWeise/distributedComputingExamples/tree/master/javaServlets/). How to find and use a given web service is often specified in [WSDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language).
